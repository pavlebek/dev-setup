"Without a properly configured terminal, I feel like a fish out of water."
													  *Anynymous developer*

Everytime I install a new Os, I find myself configuring the terminal, Git, as well asinstalling same tools all over again. The idea behind this repository is that it contains essential configuration files. That includes terminal settings(.bashrc), Git configuration (.gitconfig), list of programs/dev tools to install etc.
